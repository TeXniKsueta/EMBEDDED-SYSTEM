# EMBEDDED-SYSTEM
 Liquid level control system in the drain tank
 
This embedded system will be relevant for customers who have a drain tank with a depth of up to 10-11 meters and a diameter of 30 cm, the system under development has two pumps that perform two main functions â€“ this is draining water and collecting water into the tank. The system is being developed with two modes of operation - automatic and manual, manual mode will be necessary if the sensors fail. Also, the embedded system has all the necessary indications that indicate the state of the system mode and also an emergency situation. The system has 3 buttons that are responsible for different functions such as: automatic/manual mode, turning on pump No. 1 and turning on pump No.2. The embedded system is equipped with an emergency sensor, which, in case of a breakdown, will work out instead of the main sensor.

Figure  shows a mock-up board that simulates the operation of the system. On the breadboard there are indicators of the tank's fullness status, error indicators and an indicator of filling and draining water in the tank, as well as 3 buttons that are responsible for resetting the error, selecting the setpoint and simulating the activation of an emergency sensor. The first of the two potentiometers is user-defined and is necessary to select the desired water level in the tank, the second is the main sensor in the system.
